# Push2Meet

Google Meet with push to talk!

Currently only compatible with MacOSX.

## Installation
Go to https://github.com/Vinlock/push2meet/releases/tag/v1.0.0 download and drag the app into your applications folder!  
When you first start the application you will need to log into Google and allow a lot of permissions!!  
Once you get all the permissions, **including the accessibility one!**, out of the way...  
Restart the application...

Check out the menus for all the features! :D
